# RFD Tool

**Very much a WIP tool.** Created for specific need I found with my engineering team. Your results may vary

If you want to find out more about RFD's see Oxide's post [here](https://oxide.computer/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion)

This post is great for outlining the process. But they use an all-in-one CIO tool to handle their RFD's.  If you want to be able to display the RFDs like they do you are on your own.

This tool looks to fill this gap.

## Diagram Support

RFD Tool supports both Mermaid and D2 diagrams within your RFD documents:

- **Mermaid** - Excellent for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and Git graphs
- **D2** - Great for architectural diagrams, entity relationships, and complex layouts with custom styling

Both diagram types can be used together in the same document. See the [example RFD](docs/example-rfd.md) for a comprehensive demonstration of mixed diagram usage.
